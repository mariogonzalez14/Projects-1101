5314,64157,Alex Builds His Farm,"Alex is a lively and cheerful little boy who loves nature and animals. He often goes running along the forest paths with his dog Oscar. All the animals in the forest know him. Alex is also a great dreamer. Sometimes he sits under a tree and turns the pages of his favourite book: The Big Farming Book.  He sits there enjoying the sun, cooled by a gentle breeze. On such occasions Alex sometimes falls asleep and dreams of a magnificent farm with cows, funny little hens and affectionate horses. One day, Alex and Oscar went running in a field at the edge of the forest. In the middle of the field stood a scarecrow to keep the crows away. When Oscar and Alex passed close to the scarecrow they heard a strange noise. Alex was surprised and looked all around, but couldn't see anything strange or unusual. Just as Alex and Oscar were about to continue their race, Alex heard the noise again. It was as if someone was calling him: - Psst! Pssst! Alex, it's me! It was the scarecrow! Alex couldn't believe his eyes. - But...! You can speak! said Alex in surprise. -Yes, of course I can speak, said the scarecrow. But I only speak to children who like animals and nature. Like you, Alex! The scarecrow had a big smile. He looked nice and funny at the same time. He spoke again: -You know what Alex? I often see you sleeping under a tree in the forest. Did you know that when you dream in the middle of the forest, your dreams can come true? - Er... No, I didn't know that, said Alex. -Well, because you're a good little boy and you love nature so much, I'm going to tell you a secret: when you wake up, all you have to do is concentrate very intensely on your dream and do everything you canto make it come true! - That's easy! said Alex. - Yes! But above all, you mustn't forget to have fun! Other wise, it's no longer a dream! - Thanks, Mr Scarecrow! That's a great secret! - Bye, bye! As soon as Alex had finished talking with the scarecrow, he and Miro ran faster than ever in the direction of a large oak tree, the most majestic tree in the forest. Alex was keen to see if the scarecrow had been telling the truth. He sat down under the tree and shut his eyes. He listened to the birds singing and the sound of the wind in the trees, but Alex couldn't manage to fall asleep. He was far too excited by the scarecrow's secret! So he picked up his favourite book, the Good Farmer's Handbook and started to look at the pictures one after the other. Little by little, his eyelids shut and he fell asleep. And dreamt... He dreamt of his family, and a magnificent farm.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

23211,14986,Legend of Mana,"Legend of Mana is set in the fictional world of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the drained Mana Tree slept and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, controlled by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and its mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins.",1999-07-15 00:00:00.000,11,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.6147,29

25692,232,Half-Life: Opposing Force,"Opposing Force opens with Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.  Other Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.  Shephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.  At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.",1999-11-10 00:00:00.000,98,NULL,70.0000,1,80.7367,249

37913,4115,Syphon Filter,"Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are operatives of The Agency, on the trail of Erich Rhoemer, an international terrorist. In August of 1999, Agent Ellis attempted to infiltrate Rhoemer's narcotics operation in Guácimo, Costa Rica, but was discovered and executed by ex-KGB agent Mara Aramov. Rhoemer then ordered Anton Girdeux, a French mercenary, to burn down the plantation to hide the evidence of their Syphon Filter research.  In Washington, D.C., Edward Benton, the Agency Deputy Director, is briefing Logan's mission to Agency Director Thomas Markinson and a shadowy, unnamed figure. Several weeks later, Gabe and Lian investigate a mysterious viral outbreak in the Himalayas, which leaves only a single survivor. (Lian describes this as impossible.)  The game begins one month after the events in Costa Rica. Rhoemer and his terrorists have launched an assault on Washington, D.C. Gabe defeats Pavel Kravitch, Rhoemer's communications expert, which allows him to gain entry to the Washington Metro. Once inside, an explosive goes off leaving Gabe trapped underground. He pursues Aramov, catching her in the tunnels before heading to a nearby park to aid in the defusing of several viral bombs, where he learns that Aramov has escaped custody. Making his way to the Freedom Memorial, Gabe takes on and defeats Jorge Marcos, Rhoemer's trigger man, before he incinerates Girdeaux.  Lab results show that Syphon Filter is a deadly next-generation biological weapon, capable of targeting specific demographics. Jonathan Phagan, PHARCOM's CEO and founder, attends a gala at his new Expo Center Museum in New York City, where he is taken captive by Aramov and Benton is revealed as a double agent. Gabe kills Benton and frees Phagan, but Aramov, who is captured, again escapes custody.  Gabe goes to Rhoemer's secret base in Rozova, Kazakhstan. He kills Rhoemer's commander Vladislav Gabrek and destroys the base, but Lian is taken captive and presumably killed by Rhoemer.  Gabe is then sent to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, which is an abandoned cathedral. Injecting viral patients with what he is convinced is an antidote, Gabe descends deeper into the cathedral to rescue Lian; who explains that there is no 'global' antidote for the virus. They also find Phagan, who is later killed by Aramov. She decides to help Gabe and Lian, since she has nowhere else to go.  Gabe then infiltrates the PHARCOM warehouses in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where PHARCOM security is battling Rhoemer's men. Gabe learns that Markinson, who had been secretly negotiating with Rhoemer to obtain Syphon Filter for the Agency, had made Gabe inject the patients with potassium chloride. Rhoemer reveals he has captured a Soviet-era nuclear ICBM. Rhoemer shoots Markinson and starts the launch sequence for the missile. Gabe cannot prevent it from launching, so his only hope is to initiate its self-destruct sequence once it is in the upper atmosphere. Gabe successfully destroys the missile. Rhoemer, furious at Logan's interference, engages him in a final showdown. Gabe is able to kill him and avert World War III.  In a post-credits scene, the shadowy figure from the beginning of the game is holding a sample of Syphon Filter inside the Agency's headquarters with Aramov, who is laughing.",1999-02-17 00:00:00.000,26,NULL,90.0000,1,78.5114,75

41667,1502,Front Mission 3,"There are two plots of Front Mission 3, and both revolve around Japanese wanzer test pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama. Through a decision made early in the game, the player can play either the DHZ scenario or the USN scenario. The DHZ scenario stars Japanese scientist Aliciana ""Alisa"" Takemura, while the USN scenario revolves around scientist Emir ""Emma"" Klamsky.  Although both scenarios have different characters and story scenarios, they both share a number of events and locations in the game. Due to its storytelling approach, it is not known which of the two scenarios is canonically related to Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. On October 31, Kazuki begins testing a new prototype wanzer at a Kirishima Heavy Industries test site near Okinawa. Upon completing the test, he is informed that some construction wanzers need to be taken to the JDF base in Yokosuka. Ryogo asks Kazuki if he can join him in delivering the wanzers. If the player chooses to go with him, they will play the USN scenario. If the player does not go with him, they will play the DHZ scenario.  In either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are eventually tasked to deliver the Kirishima prototypes to the Yokosuka base. As they ready the wanzers for delivery, an explosion leads Kazuki to attempt going inside the base itself. The two test pilots are eventually forced to leave the base. Realizing that his sister Alisa was recently transferred to the base, Kazuki and Ryogo eventually find themselves back inside the complex.",1999-09-02 00:00:00.000,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.7336,21

43010,181493,Wizardry: New Age of Llylgamyn,"- Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna is the fourth scenario in the Wizardry series of computer role-playing games. It was published in 1986 by Sir-tech Software, Inc.  The Return of Werdna is drastically different from the trilogy that precedes it. Rather than continuing the adventures of the player's party from the previous three games, The Return of Werdna's protagonist is Werdna, the evil wizard that was defeated in the end of Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord and imprisoned at the bottom of his dungeon forever.  The game begins at the bottom of a 10-level dungeon. Most of Werdna's powers are depleted, and must be gradually recovered throughout the game. The initial goal is to climb to the top of the dungeon, reclaiming Werdna's full power along the way. Each level has one or more pentagrams at specific points. The pentagrams have three purposes: The first time a pentagram is discovered in a level, Werdna's strength increases, and a portion of his powers are restored. This only happens once per level; finding multiple pentagrams on a single level will not increase his powers multiple times. The second purpose is that monsters may be summoned from the pentagrams. The higher the level, the stronger the monsters available. There is no cost to summoning monsters, but only three parties of monsters may be summoned at a time, and any existing monsters will be replaced by the summoned ones. The third purpose is that pentagrams refresh Werdna's health and spellcasting capacity.  Instead of fighting monsters, the player fights against the heroes from the past three Wizardry games. Players of the first three games who sent their character disks to Sir-Tech might have their characters present in Wizardry IV.  - Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom: Despite the defeat of Trebor, Werdna, and L'kbreth, dark times once again threaten the kingdom of Llylgamyn. So once again a party of adventurers must venture forth to vanquish the evil.  Wizardry V represents a complete revision of the gaming system used in the first four installments, with larger mazes, new spells and character classes, and an expanded system for combatting and interacting with creatures. It is also the first game in the series that allows, but does not require characters imported from a previous scenario.",1999-10-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In the beginning of the game, Copper's father and two half brothers are slain by a dreadful rift hound, and Copper's own soul is torn from his body. As a result, Copper must not only retrieve his soul, but also settle the allegations now leveled against him as he was the only survivor. As the new sole heir to the Kingdom of Gladstone, many believe he orchestrated the whole incident with his father and brothers. Coupled with that is the fact that he is the result of an illicit affair between his father and a Dracoid barmaid—a half-breed heir. He must not only deal with those issues but also seek out answers to help close new rifts that have appeared throughout the Lands.    The story unfolds over many portal worlds in which Copper has to retrieve lost pieces of the Shining Path (which shattered when the Draracle left the Gladstone world). The same Draracle has sent Copper on his quest to save his life and soul as well as to save his home and world.",1999-03-03 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,43.0000,1,NULL,NULL

""Major, please, do not insult the General...""  ""**** you, **** the General, I am going to the Academy to prepare a surprise attack on the enemy.""  Major Railey was soon after locked away. But, fortunately for the Earth, before that, he managed to discover a way on how to project a residual image of our most advanced crafts to the Dimensions. Residual images were navigated from the Earth.  It was then that this Dimension was named T-Zer0.  The first craft that was sent out was destroyed in less that 0.2 seconds upon entering the T-Zer0 Dimension. But, it's computer managed to gather and send back enough information so that a proper resistance could be organized.  It was then that we learned the truth about the five Guardians. Each Guardian is protecting one diamond, and it was only by collecting all five diamonds that we would be able to open the Dimension portal and face the main Guardian. the name of the main Guardian was impossible to pronounce by us, humans, so he was given the name Kakistos. The word Kakistos originates from Greek mythology, and means ""the worst of the worst"". It was used to depict the worst demon of all. So, we only found it appropriate enough to name him this way.  It is now up to the brave cadets of the 1st Aerospace Academy to defend the Earth. We trained them the best we could, and we gave them the best crafts and weapons we have. There is nothing else we can do.  The fate of our Dimension is in their skilled hands.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
49532,117276,Recoil,"Tanks patrol desolate city streets. Turrets and missile sites threaten the skies. Robot warriors carrying pulse rifles surround military installations. What's become of Earth? Machines have taken over. Corporate greed and rapid technological advancements have made humans pawns of their own creations. During the first fifteen years of the 21st century, Mega Corp began to dominate computer technology in both peacekeeping and war-fighting applications. As this giant churned out better and better technology for manufacturing and warfare, humans were relegated to service industries or to working as drones on PC terminals. Mega Corp became the largest employer in the United States. By 2010, every computer in America used Mega Corp software and was Internet-connected and monitored through the Mega Corp Network—anti-trust suits be damned. Each day, Mega Corp would issue government-endorsed messages through the Network that broadcast pro-machine propaganda. The country was becoming brainwashed. In 2018, the wonders of artificial intelligence turned ugly in the hands of a few disillusioned Mega Corp programmers. Frustrated at being a part of such an ethically challenged corporation, these hacks altered coding in various Mega Corp products—turning certain robot and tank machinery into self-directed, man-killing machines. Today, May 2019, in a war-torn, machine-ravaged world, only a few freethinkers remain. Only a few outsiders have escaped the spell of the Network. Dr. Raines is the leader of a group of rebels called the Alliance. He and a few others have developed a computer program that gives the operator control over an experimental tank.

54855,9162,Giga Wing,"Giga Wing takes place during a fictional war within a steampunk setting. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the ""Stranger"" is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War II, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when you fight him with Stuck. There are four different characters in the game: Sinnosuke, Ruby, Isha, and Stuck; and each of them has their own individual storyline. Players can also do team play mode that has two characters at once, creating a new storyline. In each storyline, there are two endings. In the bad ending, the character the player uses will sacrifice their life in a kamikaze attack that destroys the Medallion. In team up mode, generally one of the character does this, but sometimes both characters survive. In the good endings for either solo or team play, the characters do not sacrifice themselves.",1999-03-01 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots—Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen—are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

You are Sergeant Ash, an anti terrorist specialist.    During training exercises in Africa you are suddenly recalled and flown to HQ for a top-secret briefing:    We are sorry to bring you in at such short notice Sergeant. Two days ago rebel forces took the Meteor complex by storm, they are our holding many of our troops captive. The situation has been in deadlock for some days now, we can't even get close without threats of mass destruction. We are considering these as very real threats even though we are not sure whether the rebels have the encrypted firing codes.    We need you to move in now, just be careful because there sill is plenty of fighting breaking out with the rebel forces, if they find out that we have sent someone inside the complex the situation could grow far more serious.    It is not your job to get involved with the fighting, your job is to simply carry out a number of key objectives that will feed you after you are inside. We need you to work on saving the Meteor complex while our troops attempt to hold firm.    Don't let us down Sergeant, you are best we have got.

69094,675,Driver,"NYPD officer and former racing driver John Tanner is sent undercover by his boss Lieutenant McKenzie to discover the intentions of a crime syndicate led by Castaldi. McKenzie instructs Tanner to go to Miami and meet a pimp named Rufus. After arriving in Miami, Tanner uses his driving skills to prove himself to some gangsters in a parking garage, allowing him to become their getaway driver.    Tanner carries out jobs for various gangsters before meeting Rufus, who tasks Tanner with rescuing Jean-Paul, one of Rufus's associates. Rufus is later shot by his girlfriend Jesse. Needing more information for his investigation, Tanner apprehends Jesse and takes her to the police station, where she reveals that Jean-Paul is now in San Francisco.    Tanner goes to San Francisco, where he meets Castaldi, Jean-Paul's boss, and begins working directly for him. He also meets Rusty Slater, his former racing rival, who also works for Castaldi. Tanner later learns that Castaldi is working with a man named Don Hancock, who is running for president. He later suspects that Slater has been spying on him and wrecks Slater's car during a road chase, resulting in Slater being arrested.    The Castaldi family move to Los Angeles, where Castaldi plans to assassinate FBI agent Bill Maddox as part of Castaldi's plan to carry out a more high-profile assassination in New York. Tanner tells Leck, a police associate, to ensure Maddox turns up, otherwise Tanner's cover may be affected. The assassination on Maddox is successful, but the police ambush the gangsters, forcing Tanner to take them to safety. Tanner convinces the suspicious gangsters that Slater likely told the police about the planned assassination while under interrogation. Leck later tells Tanner that McKenzie recently met Marcus Vaughn, a corrupt FBI agent who is working with Castaldi and Hancock.    The Castaldi family then move to New York, the location of the planned high-profile assassination. Tanner is told by his police associates that McKenzie wants him to pull out of the undercover operation, as he is worried that Tanner's cover will not hold up much longer, and Leck tells Tanner that Hancock has bribed several members of the FBI. Tanner remains undercover and continues working for Castaldi, intent on discovering what he is planning.    Tanner eventually learns that Castaldi plans to assassinate the President of the United States, and Tanner is tasked with driving the President's car. However, he ignores all instructions and takes the President to safety. McKenzie then arrives and tells Tanner that Castaldi and all of his associates, including Hancock and Vaughn, have been arrested. He then tells Tanner to take his badge back, but Tanner refuses, suspecting that the police and FBI are involved in the job, corrupted by bribes due to Vaughn's involvement. Tanner leaves, ignoring McKenzie completely.",1999-06-25 00:00:00.000,52,NULL,95.0000,2,76.3695,142

Joe, before becoming a more generic action/extreme sports hero on a 3D animated television show. The goal of this kid's action-adventure game is to raid your arch nemesis Dr. X’s island, rescue your sidekick who has been kidnapped and prevent Dr. X from destroying the world by polluting the environment and doing terrible experiments on plants and animals.    You start in your base and create your own hero choosing different faces, shirts, pants, etc. Training missions will improve your skills on a firing range, bungee jumping, scuba diving, taking photographs, and street luge. Then other areas will open up and Action Man will journey through varied locales such as urban cities, tropical forests, and the frozen arctic. You'll swim, jump, and climb your way through levels battling criminals and avoiding dangers of all sorts.    From your secret headquarters, you can use the monitor to see a map and choose which adventure you want to play. You can access various equipment, weapons and tools. Other features include a print function giving hard copies of colourful maps, missions, stickers and secret documents.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Less and less people can be found in cities as they lean closer to ruin. Industry becomes obsolete, while industrial skills are lost along with it. Contact between cities is scant, and those cities who are not self-sufficient are buried in the sand.

80391,11308,Ring,"Set in the 40th century, the game begins with the introduction of ISH, one of the last surviving humans. Humanity has been enslaved by an alien race that destroyed Earth millennia ago, and took away all creativity and creative expression, meaning humanity slowly lost all sense of its cultural history. However, ISH is given the chance to save humanity by the aliens. They present to him the story of the Nibelungen, and have him embody each of the four main characters in the hopes that his experiences will lead him to lust for power, which is what led to the downfall of humanity in the first place However, the goddess Erda believes she can help ISH by guiding him towards rejecting the desire for power. The four characters are Alberich (a cruel and sadistic dwarf king), Loge (a fire spirit), Siegmund (the son of the god Wotan), and Brünnhilde (a Valkyrie warrior).    The story begins with Alberich arriving back in his kingdom to discover that he has very little left, nothing in the kingdom works, and his workers have formed a union and gone on strike. In order to break up the strike, Alberich must find something to satisfy the disgruntled workers, and with this aim in mind, he sets off to procure the gold of the Rhinemaidens.    The second part has the player in control of Loge. His story intertwines somewhat with that of Alberich's - in the employ of the gods, he is charged by Wotan with retrieving the Nibelungen ring and the magic crown of Wotan from Alberich.    The third section tells the story of Siegmund, son of Wotan, as he attempts to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of his mother and sister.    The fourth section tells the story of Brünnhilde, Siegmund's half-sister, who saves him at the end of the third chapter. Her act enrages Wotan, and she is forced to flee to Valhalla where she can obtain a magic artifact to bring back to the asteroid on which the story begins - thus completing the titular ""ring"".",1999-07-05 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Godzilla fought it back, and was able to defeat it when it was weakened by its unwitting creator finally addressing his emotions. Afterward, Niko Tatopoulos called Major Anthony Hicks to tell him to stop attacking Godzilla, who had just saved the city, but Hicks revealed that no-one had orders to attack Godzilla. He was chased into the water by a helicopter, and went ashore on an island. On the island, Godzilla was attacked by more military vehicles and a population of Giant Mutant Bees, and eventually fought their Queen. After defeating the Mutant Bees, H.E.A.T. noticed that military assets were still attacking Godzilla, and they decided to continue facing them to get to their source. As Godzilla continued, he was met with more military and Cyber Flies before facing an enormous tank. After that, H.E.A.T. began to investigate tar on a beach that they believed to be linked to the disappearance of several swimmers. They were then attacked by a Mutant Giant Squid, which Godzilla defeated before more attacked, along with the military. Eventually they came upon some squids that were not charred from Godzilla's Fire Balls, but encased in the digestive tar they had found earlier. Before they could ponder for too long as to what was really creating the tar, the Crustaceous Rex surfaced and attacked Godzilla. While it was capable of using its tar to immobilize Godzilla, he was able to defeat it. After noticing that Godzilla was acting very hyperactive, H.E.A.T. was contacted by Cameron Winter, who accused them of trespassing before admitting that he was behind the odd military attacks on Godzilla in order to test his Solstice Technologies weapons, and that he was using a machine to control Godzilla. N.I.G.E.L. was able to dismantle it, and Godzilla advanced on the island and defeated updated versions of the Solstice Helicopter and Solstice Tank. Godzilla then reached the Solstice Industries facility on the island and destroyed it. With the mystery of who was attacking Godzilla behind them, H.E.A.T. and Godzilla headed back to New York City.",1999-12-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.

They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers.

During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied.    Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as ""Elemental Gimmick Gear"", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles.    100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.    At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. She sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop the tentacles' breeding.",1999-05-27 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing.

117030,126469,Vampire Hunter D,"The story of the game is similar to that of the second movie, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (which, in turn, is based on the third novel). Essentially, D, a Dhampir (transliterated as Dunpeal) vampire hunter is hired by an old man named Elbourne to save his daughter Charlotte, who was kidnapped by a vampire, Meier Link. If his daughter was already mutated into a vampiress, then D should kill her humanely. Also, Elbourne's son hired a team of human vampire hunters known as the Marcus Brothers to serve as backup. There are a fairly large number of differences between the film and the game, however. The game's story is more streamlined and the whole of the story largely takes place inside of Camila's castle.    Only two of the Barbarois mutants (Benge and Mashira) appear as enemies, Caroline being not featured. Borgoff and Leila were the only members of the Marcus brothers which were notably featured, with Leila actually becoming a playable character at one point; Kyle, Nolt, and Grove make few cameos in cutscenes, and later are found dead. There are 3 possible endings based on the player's actions in-game, 1 of which is similar to the end of the film.",1999-12-09 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

119062,43559,Hype - The Time Quest,"The story begins during King Taskan IV's reign, following the end of a civil war. Hype, the champion of the kingdom, is being rewarded for his loyalty and valor by being presented with the powerful Sword of Peace. However, during the ceremony a mysterious and powerful black knight riding a dragon unexpectedly appears. The knight steps to the King and demands the throne. At that moment, Hype steps before the knight and attempts to confront him, but the black knight is too strong and with the use of powerful magic, transforms Hype into a statue of stone and casts him deep into the past. Two hundred years earlier, Hype's statue appears in the courtyard of an apprentice magician: Gogoud.    After many failed attempts to revive Hype, the young magician, Gogoud, manages to restore Hype to life. As Hype recovers his memory he quickly explains his ordeal with the black knight - known as Barnak - and how he must return to his own time in order to protect his king, take revenge on Barnak and marry his betrothed, Vibe. Sorrowfully, Gogoud explains that he as a magician is not very experienced and is as currently only an apprentice. Still, the young man agrees to help Hype and guide him on his quest through time. Gogoud comes to learn that in order for Hype to return to the future, he must collect a number of jewels. Both are dismayed to learn that each Jewel only allows Hype to advance one leap through time, meaning that he will have to collect and charge jewels hidden in the reigns of Taskan I, II and III before returning to the era of Taskan IV. Throughout his journey, Hype meets a number of faithful friends, including: Zatila the dragon, Karon, leader of the brigands, her daughter Nohlin and many others. On the other hand, Hype also encounters a great number of foes including King Taskan I and his followers; Rajoth the magician - founder of the Laboratories; Enost - King Taskan III's wizard, who defects to the Barnak's side; numerous different soldiers, including Barnak's armies of Black Guards and other servants; Barnak's black dragon Vhoid and finally the evil Barnak himself. Hype also confronts many non-human enemies including wolves, spectres, bats and a three-headed dragon. Hype's adventures take place in the same kingdom throughout different periods of its history. Rivalries and wars erupt between the fortress, the monastery, the brigands and the magicians in the laboratories. Upon returning to his own time, Hype is reunited with Vibe and together they form an army in order to begin an uprising against Barnak, who has taken control of the kingdom. His large army enforce his diabolical regime, forcing the kingdom's people to worship their master as a God, as well as a King. The entire kingdom is guarded by Barnak's evil minions, with the main areas of the Town of Torras, the Forest, Gogoud's Manor, the Brigand Village and the Fortress being closely watched, while 'un-necessary' areas such as the Monastery, Laboratories, and the Field of Courage are closed off at Barnak's command. Most disturbing however, it is due to Barnak's conquest the land has become desolate and a fiery sky above foreshadows Barnak's triumph - causing great sadness over the kingdom's people. The land however, is finally restored to its former beauty when the Black Knight is defeated - his dark magic that plagued the kingdom broken. The spirit of Gougoud tells tales of a new world as the story ends with peace returning to the land.",1999-11-20 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The ""Guide"" (aka Skeleton and additionally known as Skelly) informs the player that they must earn puzzle pieces to escape the house. They search the various rooms of the mansion for the objects specified on the bottom of the screen. Once all of the objects in an area have been found, Skelly appears and awards the player with a puzzle piece. Once the player has collected all of the puzzle pieces, they may combine them inside the message frame to obtain instructions leading to Skelly's secret study in the library. To get into the library, the blue book must be pulled, followed by the green book and finally the red book. This causes the head on the bookshelf to move, unlocking the secret entrance to Skelly's study. The player can then escape through the window by climbing down a rope with Skelly, taking them back to the front entrance of the house. The player is then invited back into the house for more I Spy riddles. From there the player must find the ingredients to Skelly's favourite recipe: Shrinking Soup.

130427,85727,Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: Beyond the Clouds and Mountains,"The story opens in Venice with Septem (賽特), a Frankish knight and covert intelligence operative of mixed descent from Gaul who was the lieutenant to Pepin the Younger. Septem possessed an heirloom bronze vessel with an eastern design, which was in fact the Monster Fusion Vessel. He had heterochromic pupils of blue and brown, garnering discrimination and distrust from his peers and fellow knights over his somewhat Eastern appearance. Miles (麥爾斯) (the reincarnation of Satan whose memories and innate powers had not yet been fully awakened), a knight-commander under the guidance of the cleric Cornelius (康那里士) (the Dread Lord of Hell in disguise), was the polar opposite of his rival Septem, enforcing the Church's will without mercy and question, executing those designated as heretics without hesitation, and had the affection of Lilian (莉蓮), a pure maiden Septem had courted in vain. Pepin himself, however, favored Septem, and gave him a quest of great import. He was to go to the East, and find the way to achieve Absolute Victory/the Way of the King. During the journey, a simpleminded demoness named Nicole (妮可) joined Septem after being summoned by a strange dying man Septem tried to help, as an agent sent by Satan. Her mission was to awaken Septem's memory of his past life, in which he was Lucifer's most trusted ally who took part in Lucifer's Rebellion, and to convert him to Satan's cause once more, accompanied with promises of wealth, power, and demonic servants, but she eventually abandoned her mission over the fondness she developed for Septem. Kama, a self-proclaimed spirit of love, and Ankh, a snarky talking flying Egyptian black cat accompanying Kama (both of whom Septem encountered in the Tadmor Tombs), as well as Li Jing (李靖), a Chinese mortal-turned-deity who oversaw the establishment of the Tang dynasty, whose reincarnated self, Master Huiyan, previously accompanied Septem for a short time before sacrificing himself in an attempt to stop a war between the Abbasid Caliphate (which recently overthrew Umayyad rule) and Tang (which ended in the defeat of the Tang forces led by Gao Xianzhi), also joined the party. Septem also met his eventual wife, Widad (薇達), a military leader who defied Arabian patriarchal traditions and who was the reincarnated spirit twin of Kama, and the young grandson of Al-Kindi, whom Septem studied under for a short time around the time of the Abbasid Revolution, as well as Wang Siyue (王思月), a willful young woman from Chang'an with feelings for Septem, along his journey. After finally reaching China and encountering a variety of conflicts, including the An Lushan Rebellion, the group discovered Satan's plan to subjugate all worlds by using the Reversal of Mandala Ritual (反曼陀羅陣), which Septem's past incarnation invented and gained time traversal powers from, to modify the natural laws of causality, and managed to foil it with the assistance of The Immortal of Xuan-yuan Sword (the avatar of the Xuan-Yuan Sword who takes on the form of a stern and wise old man). After Satan's defeat, Septem married Widad, returned to assist Charlemagne with lessons from his journey-that a ruler must rule in the best interests of the commonfolk, and the way to ensure victory lies in the prevention and cessation of conflicts, and later reunited with Nicole, who was reborn once more as a normal girl by the grace of Heaven.",1999-12-04 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core. This greatly weakens the resistance's power and disables Rayman's powers, leading to his capture.[9]  Globox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship. Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10]  In the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir.  Eventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes.

His grandfather was too busy taking care of the farm to spend much time with him, so the boy explored the town and countryside on his own.  The boy befriended his grandfather's puppy and met a little girl his own age with whom he became close friends. When the summer was over the boy had to go back home, but he promised the little girl that he would return someday.    Ten years later, years after his grandfather's death, the boy – now a grown man – returns to the town to take over the farm. Upon meeting the main character, the mayor and other villagers decide that he would be allowed to stay as the rightful owner if he restored the farm to its original state within three years.

134617,11094,Atlantis 2: Beyond Atlantis,"In this adventure game, take Ten, the Bearer of Light, through his journey to Shambhala to confront the Bearer of Dark so that balance can be returned to the Universe. To find Shambhala, he must gather the pieces that make up the ""road to Shambhala"" from different locations and time periods – China, Ireland and the Yucatán.  You begin aboard a ship in the mountains of Tibet, which acts as a home base. As the pieces are found and put in place, Ten is mystically transported to exotic locations and will become different characters. Each ""chapter"" can be played in any order since each is self-contained with its own puzzles, objects and people. Although each chapter is autonomous the final reward of each one is another piece of ""the road to Shamballa"".  Yucatán The character in the Yucatán chapter is Tepec, a loyal follower of a local city's king. Tepec's kingdom is in trouble because its protector-god, Quetzalcoatl (the Feathered Serpent), has fallen asleep and as a result great misfortunes happen to the kingdom; the corn crop is dying and a rival king makes a campaign to conquer Tepec's kingdom. So Tepec is assigned with the mission to go to the land of the dead, Xibalba, and awaken Quetzalcoatl to receive chulel, the divine blood which has life giving powers.  Ireland Ten is transformed into Felim, a monk living in an Irish monastery in the early centuries of Christianity. He discovers a living remain of an ancient Irish king and then begins interacting with a set of characters from an old myth which is written in a book in the monastery library. His final goal is to help the characters get to the end of the story.  China In this chapter Ten is in the body of a travelling Chinese civil servant who is stuck in a monastery because a ghost-shadow is blocking the entrance. As water supplies are running short, he decides to use the help of the Master of Directions to travel to a Chinese version of the land of the dead to consult an immortal excorcism master.  Shamballa Shamballa is a fantasy place, which acts as a final screen of protection between the home base and the Dark's prison. Queen Rhea, a character from the prequel of the series is waiting there to link the story between the two games and guide Ten to the final level of the game, which is no other than the sunk Atlantis.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,70.0000,2,40.0000,2

According to the letter, Tabby, Tomba's childhood friend, has disappeared. Wracked with anxiety, Tomba leaps into the sea in search of her. Tomba and Zippo wind up in a fisherman village where they meet an old man named Kainen. From there they move on to the Coal-Mining Town where Tabby's house is, but discover that she is unavailable. Gran, a denizen of the Coal-Mining Town, mentions seeing Tabby travel to the Kujara Ranch by trolley, but the trolley she used to travel there returns empty. A panicking trolley worker reveals that the Evil Pigs kidnapped Tabby when she tried to protect a penchant that was given to her by Tomba as a gift. Gran explains that the Evil Pigs have cursed the entire continent, and gives Tomba a red Pig Bag that is capable of capturing the Flame Pig that has cast his spell on the mines.  Tomba ventures throughout the continent gathering the rest of the Pig Bags. He cures the Coal-Mining Town of its inferno by capturing the Evil Flame Pig, cures the Kujara Ranch of its perpetual snowfall by capturing the Evil Ice Pig, cures the Donglin Forest's gloominess by capturing the Evil Ghost Pig, lifts the Circus Town's curse (which has turned its citizens into pigs) by capturing the Evil Earth Pig and cures the Water Temple of its perpetual rainfall by capturing the Evil Water Pig. When all of these Evil Pigs have been captured, their leader, the Last Evil Pig, reveals himself to Tomba and tempts him to find his lair. Tomba and Zippo locate the Last Evil Pig in an underground area underneath the Coal-Mining Town, where the Last Evil Pig freezes time in a last-ditch effort to stop Tomba. A final battle against the Last Evil Pig ends with his capture, but he promises his eventual return. Tomba and Zippo find Tabby in the Last Evil Pig's lair and escape the collapsing area on the back of the flying dog Baron. Following a feast at Tabby's home, Kainen appears and gives Tomba a monkey suit for him to wear as a reward for going on every adventure possible (if the player completed 133 events, it'll be black but if they completed those along with the 4 extra events, it'll be red). Tomba is allowed to pilot the local windmill owner's new boat to return home. However, Tomba gets involved in an accident on the boat's maiden voyage.",1999-10-28 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,74.9321,20

Though without any witnesses, the one leading the Dimensions with overwhelming power was a robot like Rockman. He was said to be a dark and wicked person completely obsessed with destruction. Rockman, who heard this news at Right's laboratory, took off to the scene despite being under maintenance. At the same time, Wily saw the dark Rockman, and to ascertain the mystery he sends Forte to the city. Just who is this dark Rockman really?!  Rockman Shadow: ""My name is Rockman Shadow! I am a robot with great power. I won't forgive those who don't obey me!"" Rockman: ""Stop your harming of everyone! Who the heck are you? How can it be you look just like me?"" Forte: ""I've come to end the life of Rockman who I hate to this day, but somehow this situation is different than usual."" Rockman: ""Forte, I don't have time to be concerned with that now. I must hold back those robots!"" Forte: ""Ch! It can't be helped, Wily's laboratory is near this city. I won't carry out our war of attrition here!"" For the time being, the two had to set aside their differences and face the new threat of the Dimensions. After defeating all of them, they face their leader, Rockman Shadow. He briefly discusses Quint, a version of Rockman that previously came from the future but was captured and customized by Dr. Wily.

The beauty and harmony of the kingdom are protected by seven magical crystals, which sit on the spires of the castle. The wizard is aided in his magic by a pair of magic, four-fingered gloves, which are sentient. One day, though, the wizard accidentally mixes together a bad batch of potions, which create a massive explosion. The mishap turns the wizard into a statue, and sends his magic gloves in two directions—one flies out the window, while the other lands in a cauldron. The explosion also shakes the crystals from the spires, and they hurtle to the ground. The glove that landed outside—Glover—quickly casts a spell to transform the crystals into rubber balls to prevent them from shattering on the ground. They bounce away, entering the magical realms around the kingdom. Without the crystals, though, the world transforms into a foggy, desolate wasteland. To make matters worse, the other glove is corrupted by the potion in the cauldron and becomes the villain, Cross-Stitch.",1999-10-04 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The traveler’s knowledge, skills and power led them to believe that he was the chosen Emissary of the god Ceth. As time passed, the traveler taught the people of Shrikar how to Weave, or shape the natural energy flows of their planet. The Emissary also taught the basic skills of architecture and of controlling creatures of the land, improving the way life for the people of Shrikar. An age of prosperity and enlightenment began and the people lived better than ever before.  As the people of Shrikar continued to advance in their skill and knowledge of Weaving, the Emissary left to continue his journey once more. To honor him and his teachings, the people created the Arcomage Guild; a school dedicated to the knowledge that the Emissary brought to Shrikar. Graduation from this Guild bestowed the title of Arcomage upon the worthy student, one who understood and excelled in the ways of Weaving, of Control and of Building. The Golden Age of Shrikar had reached its pinnacle.  One hundred years after the departure of the Emissary, the first Arcomage War struck the people of Shrikar. The Arcomage Crowhain assaulted the citadel of the Arcomage Ralbeard. The surrounding countryside was laid to waste. Years after the war started, Ralbeard completely destroyed the citadel of his enemy. The scars upon the world of Shrikar were slow to heal. Over the next five hundred years the people of Shrikar would experience the wars of Arcomages hundreds of times, as mages strove to increase their power and reputations.  You have been challenged, Arcomage! The enemy is at the gates and it is now time to put your skills and tactics to the test.

The game strives to be relevant in the real world by being part of the game. Does that stand to reason? By tying the concept of the game of Omikron strongly to reality and defining the player’s character in terms of their actual life, we clearly connected the parallel universe to our own. In effect, the player’s own life becomes our setting. Quantic believes it may be the world’s first Buddhist game--Buddhist with guns, I call it.” – Eidos Senior Designer Philip Campbell  Soon after the player begins the investigation in Anekbah sector, he uncovers information that suggests the serial killer he is looking for is, in fact, not human but actually a demon. When members of an apparent underground, anti-government movement contact the player and confirm his suspicions, the investigation deepens and uncovers information that one of Omikron's chief police commanders (Commandant Gandahar) is, in fact, a demon pretending to be human and luring human souls into Omikron from other dimensions by way of the video game that the player is actually interacting with. Despite many attempts on his life by other demons working behind the scenes, the player then uses supernatural weaponry of ancient origin to destroy Gandhar. After this brief victory, the player is then invited to join the mysterious anti-government movement that call themselves ""The Awakened"", referring to the fact they have ""awakened"" from the lies and drugs of the government. The Awakened work in tandem with an ancient religious order who are led by ""Boz"", a mystical being that exists in purely electronic form on the computer networks of Omikron. The Awakened refer to the player as ""The Nomad Soul"" since he has the ability to change bodies at will. The Nomad Soul also learns that what is going on in Omikron is merely an extension of a thousands-of-years-old battle between mankind and demons led by the powerful Astaroth. Astaroth, who was banished to the depths of Omikron long ago, is slowly regenerating power while using demons to both collect souls and impersonate high members of the government so that he can eventually take complete control and move across the planet and, indeed, the universe. Only by harnessing ancient, magical technology and re-discovering several hidden tombs and catacombs underneath Omikron's surface, can the Nomad Soul hope to discover how to destroy Astaroth, return to his own dimension, and prevent his soul from being captured by demons.",1999-10-31 00:00:00.000,12,NULL,70.0000,1,81.1017,20

The Guardian is helped by Lord Blackthorn, who leads the Wyrmguards and forces the people to obey the Guardian.  As the quest progresses, the Avatar learns that the Guardian has stolen the Runes of the Virtues and twisted them into the glyphs that form the heart of each of the columns. Most of the game consists of traveling through the dungeons to recover the glyphs and visiting the Shrines of the Virtues to meditate and cleanse them. Eventually, it is revealed that the Guardian is nothing other than the dark half of the Avatar himself, and the only way to save Britannia is for the Avatar to ascend to a higher plane, taking the Guardian with him.

161338,1307,Medal of Honor,"BEFORE THE CIA, THERE WAS THE OSS  The Office of Strategic Services was officially created in June 1942, under the guidance of General 'Wild Bill' Donovan. If ever the romantic notions of being a spy actually excited, it was probably with the OSS. Young men and women, often recruited right out of college, entered into the cloak and dagger world of wartime intelligence. It was an exciting and dangerous time, and as the war grew so did the mission of the OSS. Sabotage, search & rescue and subversion all became part of the organisation's daily operation.  That's when a young Lieutenant in the Air Transport Corps entered the picture and changed the OSS forever. On June 5, 1944 - the night before the D-Day invasion - the largest aerial drop of troops in history up to that point was launched by the Allied command. It was an unmitigated disaster. Most of the planes missed thier targets, were shot down or crashed due to bad weather. One pilot, however, got the regiment he was carrying to its correct drop zone before his C-47 transport was forced down by enemy fire. He was Jimmy Patterson, an unassuming twenty-four year old from Carthage, MO.  Patterson heroically protected his injured crew from a roving German patrol, single-handedly taking out a half dozen of the Wehrmacht before help arrived. For his actions, he was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor - the nation's highest military award. Just days before being sent back to the States for a War Bonds tour, however, Patterson disappeared from his infirmary bed. Medal of Honor tells the story of what happened next.",1999-10-31 00:00:00.000,33,NULL,75.0000,1,77.9278,108

Operation Bulldog and Task Force Serpent have already completed their objectives, but there is one last operation left—the one with which the player is tasked—the disruption of a ranking Smoke Jaguar officer's attempt to rally and restore the Clan forces. This mission (codename: Damocles) is to destroy key Smoke Jaguar installations on the planet Tranquil, including a mech factory, a starport, a geothermal power plant, and the Smoke Jaguar control structure. The mission is a commando operation with limited forces, and does not include elimination of the enemy as an objective.    Two dropships are deployed to release the BattleMech force to destroy these installations. However, while in orbit above Tranquil, a dropship is attacked by naval laser fire. The Blackhammer is shot down and the remaining dropship, the Eclipse, retreats to safety. The player was already deployed from the dropship, which had been slightly off target before it was destroyed. The Mobile Field Bases (MFB), which were deployed at the same time as the player, land on target. The player's first mission is to rendezvous with the MFBs and secure the area from hostile forces.    At least seven Mechs are deployed. Two are destroyed by the enemy near the beginning of the game and one toward the end. The novelization mentions one more casualty lost due to a parachute malfunction. The remaining four survivors gradually link up over the course of the game. Twelve more Mechs remain aboard the Eclipse, but they cannot be deployed directly, and an attempt to fight through from a safe landing area fails after heavy casualties. Despite this setback, the player must continue with his objectives, and eventually secure a landing zone so the dropship can return to evacuate them.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,1,NULL,NULL,89.4890,7
